Grits (Generally Ridiculous In Terms Of Scope) is a dynamic programming language.

Grits is designed to be used mainly in Rapid Application Development and prototyping but is powerful enough to be used in place of virtually any other dynamic, interpreted language.

There are no keywords in the core language, only key symbols. This reduces a) the size of source files and b) effort!

Most importantly of all, Grits is a fun language to code in.
